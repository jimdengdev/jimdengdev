# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm [Your Name]  
**Backend Engineer | AIGC Enthusiast**

I'm a backend developer passionate about building robust and efficient systems. My main development languages are Go and C++ , which I use for business logic and backend services. I also enjoy scripting and working on agent projects with Python , and occasionally develop in Java .

I'm deeply interested in AIGC (AI Generated Content) and will soon share new technologies and insights in this field. Feel free to connect or collaborate!
